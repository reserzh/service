# Product Overview

## Vision

A modern, multi-tenant field service management (FSM) platform for residential and commercial service companies (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and similar trades). The platform targets the underserved mid-market: companies with 5-30 technicians who need more than entry-level tools like Jobber but find enterprise platforms like ServiceTitan too expensive and complex.

**Goal:** Deliver 80% of ServiceTitan's core value at a fraction of the cost, with a dramatically simpler onboarding experience and a UI that office staff and field techs actually enjoy using.

## Target Users

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Company Admin / Owner** | Manages company settings, users, billing, reporting, and website content |
| **Office Manager / Dispatcher** | Schedules jobs, dispatches techs, manages customers, handles estimates and invoices |
| **CSR (Customer Service Rep)** | Books calls, creates customers, handles inbound requests |
| **Field Technician** | Views schedule, updates job status, captures photos/signatures, collects payments (primarily mobile) |
| **End-Customer** | Visits the tenant's public website to browse services, book appointments online, submit contact requests, receive estimates, approve work, and pay invoices |

## Market Opportunity

- Global FSM market: $5.49B in 2025, projected $23.61B by 2035 (16% CAGR)
- 68%+ of US service companies already use FSM software
- The mid-market segment (5-30 techs) is underserved: too complex for Jobber, too expensive for ServiceTitan

## Competitive Landscape

| Platform | Target | Starting Price | Strength | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ServiceTitan | 20-100+ techs | ~$250-500+/mo | Deep features, AI dispatch | Expensive, complex, slow onboarding |
| Housecall Pro | 1-10 techs | $59/mo | Easy to use, fast payments | Limited at scale |
| Jobber | 1-15 techs | $39/mo | Simple, reliable | Lacks advanced features |
| FieldEdge | 5-30 techs | Custom | Trade-specific | Dated UI, limited innovation |
| **Our Platform** | **5-30 techs** | **TBD** | **Modern UX, fast setup, API-first** | **New entrant** |
